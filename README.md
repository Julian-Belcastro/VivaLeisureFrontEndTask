# General retro/comments on this task
- React + TypeScript + Vite Template used
- This is my solution using the required technologies after not having touched them for ~1 year
- I aimed to follow the Figma Styling to as high a degree as possible, though I understand a couple of minor differences exist
- Comments made throughout code to highlight sections
- MaterialUI + react-modal libraries were used, although I would have been happy to make do without them if necessary
- 'YOUR MEMBERSHIP' stage incomplete due to time availability - please let me know if you would like that finished to further gauge ability
- I chose to do my styling (majority of it) through Modal.css, though I would have also been comfortable using the styled components (styled-components) library or bootstrap styling  e.g. className='d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center p-2'
- Mobile stying was done via using the baseline of @media (max-width: 1024px), although multiple breakpoints would be used in production to ensure a smooth/comfortable user experience across multiple device types
- I will be more than happy to receive any and all feedback please!
